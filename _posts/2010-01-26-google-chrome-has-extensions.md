I’ve been using Google Chrome a lot more for casual browsing lately. I continue to use Firefox with Firebug for web development tasks, but for social networking and email I use Chrome. Perhaps its because I have loaded down Firefox with too many extensions, but I can’t get over how much faster Chrome is. And the latest beta (version 4) now supports extensions. So far I’ve added five extensions and I haven’t noticed a difference in speed.
