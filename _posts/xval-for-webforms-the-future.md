Based on comments I’ve received from my last [xVal for WebForms post](http://www.jrummell.com/blog/2011/03/the-state-of-xval-for-webforms/ "The State of xVal for WebForms"), I’ve decided on a direction. The project will keep jQuery Validation but will move away from the xVal dependency. We’ll be trying the approach outlined by Dave Ward at [Encosia](http://encosia.com/2009/11/04/using-jquery-validation-with-asp-net-webforms/).
