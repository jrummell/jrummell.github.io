I moved my blog from [BlogEngine.NET](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/) to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). My main reason for moving away from BE is that there just aren’t that many themes and plugins available for the latest release, 1.6.1.0. However, now that I’ve completed my transition I just saw that BE 2.0 RC is now available. And they also added [Janko](http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/) to their team, which leads me to believe that there will be some very cool themes available. Perhaps I should have waited?
