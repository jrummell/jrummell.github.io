# Visual Studio’s Transact-SQL Editor


I’ve been using Visual Studio for years, but I just learned something new that’s been around since at least Visual Studio 2005. It has a built in [Transact-SQL Editor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd380721.aspx) that you can use to write and execute SQL queries. From what I can tell, it looks like a component of SQL Server Management Studio 2008. You can access it from the **Transact-SQL** option in the **Data** menu, which opens the editor in a new tab.
